  // closure = A function defined inside of another function,  the inner function has access to the variables and scope of the outer function.
//Allow for private variables and state maintenance 
// Used frequently in JS frameworks: React, Vue, Angular

  // we could have declared count as global and used
  //just a regular function but that would make 
  //variable vulnerable to change in large codespace
  // so we are encapsulating it inside closures

  /*
At the end of createGame, you return an object that contains references to the three functions increaseScore, decreaseScore, and getScore.

This is where destructuring comes into play: instead of returning each function separately or manually accessing them later, you group them together in an object and return them all at once.

By returning this object, you allow access to these functions outside of createGame while keeping the score variable private.




Breakdown of Destructuring:


return { increaseScore, decreaseScore, getScore };

This line uses object shorthand syntax to return an object with three properties:

increaseScore

decreaseScore

getScore


Each of these properties corresponds to the functions defined within createGame. Since the property names match the function names, you can simply write { increaseScore, decreaseScore, getScore } instead of { increaseScore: increaseScore, decreaseScore: decreaseScore, getScore: getScore }.

By returning an object in this manner, you're able to destructure this object when you use the function, allowing you to access the methods directly:

const { increaseScore, decreaseScore, getScore } = createGame();

increaseScore(10);  // You increased 10 score
console.log(getScore()); // 10

decreaseScore(5);  // You decreased 5 score
