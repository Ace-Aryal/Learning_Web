JavaScript Functions: Modularity and Clean Code

1. Functions: More than Reusability

While functions are known for allowing code reusability, their real power lies in their ability to keep code clean, modular, and readable. Functions should be designed to do one task at a time, even if that task involves more lines of code. This helps in:

Maintaining clarity.

Making the code easier to debug and maintain.

Ensuring the function has a specific, well-defined purpose.


Example:

function calculateTotalPrice(price, tax) {
    return price + tax;
}

function applyDiscount(total, discount) {
    return total - discount;
}

let totalPrice = calculateTotalPrice(100, 10); // Task 1: Calculate price with tax
let finalPrice = applyDiscount(totalPrice, 5); // Task 2: Apply discount

In this example, each function performs a single task, making it modular and easier to maintain. Good function naming is also crucial here, as it lets us understand the functionality without diving into the implementation details.

2. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The Single Responsibility Principle states that each function should focus on one task only. By following this, functions can be named meaningfully, helping developers (and yourself in the future) easily understand the purpose of a function just by reading its name.

Example of SRP:

function validateEmail(email) {
    return email.includes("@");
}

function sendEmail(email) {
    if (validateEmail(email)) {
        // logic to send email
        return "Email sent";
    }
    return "Invalid email";
}

Here, the validateEmail function has a single responsibility: checking if an email is valid. The sendEmail function uses validateEmail to determine whether to proceed. This modularity ensures each function does one job, improving code readability.

3. Longer Code vs Shorter, Messy Code

Often, developers aim to write short, concise code, but it should not come at the cost of clarity. It’s perfectly fine if a function is longer, as long as it performs a single task and the function's purpose is easily understood.

Example:

function processTransaction(order) {
    const price = calculatePrice(order);
    const tax = calculateTax(price);
    const totalPrice = price + tax;

    const discountedPrice = applyDiscount(totalPrice);
    return finalizeOrder(discountedPrice);
}

This function, although longer, is clear because each sub-function (calculatePrice, calculateTax, applyDiscount, etc.) focuses on one task. This modularity helps keep the overall code structure simple and logical.

4. Function Naming

A well-named function allows developers to understand what the function does without going through its entire code. If a function is doing one thing, you can give it a name that directly reflects its action.

Example:

function calculateTax(income) {
    return income * 0.2;
}

By looking at the name calculateTax, it’s immediately clear that this function’s job is to calculate the tax on an income. This makes the code self-documenting, reducing the need for additional comments or explanations.
